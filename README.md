# ConcordanceProgram
Concordance program: a program to count the number of occurrences of words in a passage.
The program will read white-space separated words from a file, convert all words to a single case,
and remove any non-alphanumeric characters from both ends of the words, limited to one character on both ends.
It is to count the number of each word, and then write to a file a list of word/count pairs, sorted by word.
The program will take 2 command-line arguments: a filename for the input and a filename for the output.
The sorting to be done using bubble sort.
The word should be left justified and the count right justified.
